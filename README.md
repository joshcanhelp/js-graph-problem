# A Graph Problem in JavaScript

I was recently posed a question regarding graphing problems in JavaScript. I solved the problem using a few online resources (to understand the terminology) and my own brain. Unfortunately, I was not given any feedback as to whether this answer was sufficient or not so I'm posting it here. 

No guarantees as to the accuracy of these calculations. I accept any and all feedback, issues and pull requests to create a good resource.
